        "description": "As you may already know, because we bang on about it enough, over 90% of our remaining carbon footprint is made up of audience travel, and we're constantly looking for new ways to hammer that down… In 2022, you lot set a new record for arriving on public transport, with nearly a third of you rocking up on one of our coaches, by bicycle or by train and shuttle bus, saving carbon and also saving cash, as our coach and cycle packages are priced £20 cheaper than regular entry tickets. Huge big ups to every single one of you who chose to travel to Shambala sustainably."

        "description": "In 2023, we will once again be partnering with Red Fox Cycling, to offer guided bike rides from different cities to Shambala. Our bike rides run from Bristol, London, Sheffield and (new for 2023) Birmingham. Cyclist Tickets are priced £20 cheaper than regular entry tickets - as a thank you for choosing to travel so sustainably. What's more, a Red Fox guided tour costs half what you would expect for a regular cycling holiday, so this really is a bargain. Take the scenic route, stop at beautiful campsites along the way and arrive at Shambala with a host of new pals."
